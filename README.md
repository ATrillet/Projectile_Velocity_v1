# Projectile_Velocity_v1
First version of the projectile velocity code

This is the code that we hoped to use in order to read to pins of an arduino fast enough to detect a projectile passing through two light gates.

Calculations of the estimated time that it takes an arduino to run each line of code was determined showed that this should work in the designed project

At the end of the first semester of working on this project we were recommend to try using interrupts instead of loops, as they might be a better method of detecting pin changes at precise times.  This change can be seen in Projectile_Velocity_v1.
